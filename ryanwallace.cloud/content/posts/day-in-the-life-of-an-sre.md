title = 'Day in the Life of an SRE'
+++

I am a [Site Reliability Engineer](https://sre.google/) at Red Hat. During one of our team meetings,
one of my coworkers mentioned that they had met a few coworkers at the media department of Red Hat
and they were looking for an SRE to explain a day in their life. So, here is that video... which
will forever torment me and its extremely memeable quotes.
