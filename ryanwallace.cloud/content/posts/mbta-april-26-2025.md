Here is an MBTA Commuter Rail trip that I took from South Station in Boston, MA to Fall River Depot, on
Phase 1 of South Coast Rail. The trip was hosted by [TransitMatters](https://transitmatters.org/), a non-profit
advocacy organization focused on increasing mobility in Massachusetts.

They include a sign saying "no crossing and no work allow unless all trains stopped by occ", a sign to the right says "tunnel being monitored by security equipment, to exit you must tap employee I.D." and the final one says "no smoking"](https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/ryan-wallace-cloud-public/scr/south_coast_rail%20-%2019.jpeg)
